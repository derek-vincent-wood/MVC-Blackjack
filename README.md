# MVC-Blackjack
The goal of this project is to develop a C++ console application using the Model-View-Controller design pattern as described in "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, et al. Other design patterns will be used as needed, such as the Command design pattern. A minimum of one user will play against a simple dealer.

The reasoning for using Model-View-Controller (MVC) is three fold: 

First, I have a bit of background with it courtesy of two school projects (if I receive permission from my former instructor, I will upload them as their own repositories) and I want to improve on my understanding of it. Being able to separate the concerns of the data, how it is displayed, and how both the display and data are manipulated is quite powerful.
  
Second, I want to use this project as a launching point for learning other skills. While currently the plan is to make this relatively simple by starting out as a console application with minimal intelligence for the dealer, the usage of MVC should allow for me to upgrade the model, view, or controller as I see fit. The current plan is to fully complete the project as a pure console application in a Linux environment, before upgrading it to use a graphics library such as Vulkan. I may also consider making the dealer more intelligent.

Third, I want to get more experience in writing UML diagrams, and the MVC design pattern should offer multiple opportunities to do so.



As I go about completing this project, my goal is to provide clear, precise, and consistent documentation. I will be making my UML diagrams using draw.io, a convenient and free flowchart design tool. These diagrams will then be published in the repository. 

This project will also be written in C++. I have found that I enjoy coding in C++ after being introduced to it during the Spring 2021 semester of my senior year at the University of Connecticut, and I hope that this project allows me to expand on my skills in it.
